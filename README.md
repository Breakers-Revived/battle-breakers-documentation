### What is Battle Breakers?

Battle Breakers was a cartoon-themed Hero collector, Turn-Based, and Action RPG game developed by Chair Entertainment
and Epic Games. Released in beta in 2016 and launched in 2019, the game has since been shut down at the end of 2022.

### What is this repository?

This repository is a collection of all the API calls made by the game, and the data they return. This is a work in
progress, and will be updated as more information is found. If you have any information to add, please feel free to open
a pull request. **If you reference any of this information in your own work, please credit / link back to this
repository.**

### Where are the docs?

The docs are located in the [docs](docs) folder. The docs are written in Markdown, organised by the API endpoint they
reference, and are generated by [this script](res/har%20markdown%20renderer.py) I wrote. Some requests/responses are
altered to remove sensitive information.
