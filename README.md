### What is Battle Breakers?

Battle Breakers was a cartoon-themed Hero collector, Turn-Based, and Action RPG game developed by Chair Entertainment
and Epic Games. Released in beta in 2016 and launched in 2019, the game was since shut down at the end of 2022.

### What is this repository?

This repository is a collection of all the API calls made by the game, and the data they return. This is a work in
progress, and will be updated as more information is found. If you have any information to add, please feel free to open
a pull request.

### **If you reference any of this information in your own work, please credit / link back to this repository.**

### Where are the docs?

The docs are located in the **[docs](https://github.com/Breakers-Revived/battle-breakers-documentation/blob/main/docs/README.md)** folder. The docs are written in Markdown, organised by the API endpoint they
reference, and are generated by [this script](res/har%20markdown%20renderer.py) I wrote. Some requests/responses are
altered to remove sensitive information.

### What's missing?

<details>

<summary>MCP Operations</summary>

These are MCP Operations that did not have their behaviour fully documented from the official server, however almost all are functional on the [server emulator](https://github.com/breakers-revived/battle-breakers-private-server).

- [x] AddFriend
- [ ] ClaimGiftPoints
  - Unfortunately ClaimGiftPoints, along with the notification data required for receiving gift points was lost. If you have or can find any Battle Breakers sessions, packet captures, etc; and/or can assist with SDK dumping a **32-bit** UE 4.25 title, please contact me on Discord at `dippy is not here`.
- [x] DeleteFriend
- [x] MarkHeroSeen
- [x] MarkItemSeen
- [x] RedeemToken

<summary>API Endpoints</summary>

These are additional API endpoints under the WEX service that were not documented.

- [x] wex/api/game/v2/friends/`accountid`/search?name=
  - This endpoint was used for the legacy friends system on pre-1.80 clients, and was documented by Lele [here](https://github.com/LeleDerGrasshalmi/FortniteEndpointsDocumentation/blob/main/EpicGames/WexService/Game/SearchFriends.md)
- [x] wex/api/game/v2/item_ratings
  - Specifically the POST for when casting votes on characters
- [ ] wex/api/game/v2/motd
- [x] wex/api/feedback/log-upload/
- [ ] wex/api/push/`accountid`/register (notifications)
- [x] wex/api/storeaccess/v1/redeem_access/`accountid`
- [x] wex/api/storeaccess/v1/request_access/`accountid`
- [x] wex/api/accesscontrol/status

These are additional API endpoints on other services that were not documented.

- [ ] https://www.epicgames.com/battlebreakers/motd?rvn=-1
- [ ] https://bbcontent-website-prod07.ol.epicgames.com/content/api/pages/`key`
  - This was a clone of Fortnite's content API, however it went unused by game clients. The key for this service was never found, and on ~2/06/2024, the service was removed.
- [ ] account/api/public/account/`accountid`/externalAuths (linking accounts)

<summary>Manifests & Chunks</summary>

These manifests and chunks were hosted on an S3 Bucket, which was later put behind cloudfront, and then additionally put behind a CDN when the system switched to using Build Manifests. The S3 bucket was deleted on ~2/06/2024, rendering all of these manifests and chunks unavailable officially. 

- [x] ChunkV3 HTTPChunkInstaller Manifests & Chunks
    - Used by old builds (Used by 1.0.x - 1.5.x)
    - Platforms: WindowsNoEditor, Android_ASTC, Android_ATC, Android_DXT, Android_ETC1, Android_ETC2, Android_PVRTC,
      IOS
    - As the master manifests were stored under wex, they are no longer available (however I re-created them manually, and they can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Breakers-Revived/battle-breakers-private-server/tree/development/res/wex/api/game/v2/manifests))
    - As of ~2/06/2024, all Battle Breakers S3 buckets have been deleted, and ChunkV3 manifests + chunks are no longer available anywhere officially.
- [x] Build Manifests
    - Used by new mobile builds (Used by 1.6.x - 1.88.x)
    - Platforms: Windows, Android_ASTC, Android_ATC, Android_DXT, Android_ETC1, Android_ETC2, Android_PVRTC, IOS
    - As of ~2/06/2024, all Battle Breakers S3 buckets have been deleted, and Build Manifest manifests + PAKs are no longer available anywhere officially.
